    "# Multiple layer models and Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore network models with multiple layers of transformations. This will build upon the single-layer affine model we looked at in the previous notebook and use material covered in the [second](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/2016/mlp02-sln.pdf) and [third](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/2016/mlp03-mlp.pdf) lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use these models for the experiments you will be running in the first coursework so part of the aim of this lab will be to get you familiar with how to construct multiple layer models in our framework and how to train them.\n",

    "## What is a layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when discussing (neural) network models, a network layer is taken to mean an input to output transformation of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\boldsymbol{y} = \\boldsymbol{f}(\\mathbf{W} \\boldsymbol{x} + \\boldsymbol{b})\n",
    "    \\qquad\n",
    "    \\Leftrightarrow\n",
    "    \\qquad\n",
    "    y_k = f\\left(\\sum_{d=1}^D \\left( W_{kd} x_d \\right) + b_k \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{W}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}$ parameterise an affine transformation as discussed in the previous notebook, and $f$ is a function applied elementwise to the result of the affine transformation. For example a common choice for $f$ is the logistic sigmoid function \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  f(u) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-u)}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second lecture slides you were shown how to train a model consisting of an affine transformation followed by the elementwise logistic sigmoid using gradient descent. This was referred to as a 'sigmoid single-layer network'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we also referred to single-layer models, where in that case the layer was an affine transformation, with you implementing the various necessary methods for the `AffineLayer` class before using an instance of that class within a `SingleLayerModel` on a regression problem. We could in that case consider the function $f$ to simply be the identity function $f(u) = u$. In the code for the labs we will however use a slightly different convention. Here we will consider the affine transformations and subsequent elementwise function $f$ to each be a separate transformation layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will mean we can combine our already implemented `AffineLayer` class with any non-linear function applied to the outputs just by implementing a layer object for the relevant non-linearity and then stacking the two layers together. An alternative would be to have our new layer objects inherit from `AffineLayer` and then call the relevant parent class methods in the child class however this would mean we need to include a lot of the same boilerplate code in every new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a concrete example, in the `mlp.layers` module there is a definition for a `SigmoidLayer` equivalent to the following (documentation strings have been removed here for brevity)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SigmoidLayer(Layer):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def fprop(self, inputs):\n",
    "        return 1. / (1. + np.exp(-inputs))\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bprop(self, inputs, outputs, grads_wrt_outputs):\n",
    "        return grads_wrt_outputs * outputs * (1. - outputs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see this `SigmoidLayer` class has a very lightweight definition, defining just two key methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `fprop` which takes a batch of activations at the input to the layer and forward propagates them to produce activates at the outputs (directly equivalently to the `fprop` method you implemented for then `AffineLayer` in the previous notebook),\n",
    "  * `brop` which takes a batch of gradients with respect to the outputs of the layer and backward propagates them to calculate gradients with respect to the inputs of the layer (explained in more detail below).\n",
    "  \n",
    "This `SigmoidLayer` class only implements the logistic sigmoid non-linearity transformation and so does not have any parameters. Therefore unlike `AffineLayer` it is derived directly from the base `Layer` class rather than `LayerWithParameters` and does not need to implement `grads_wrt_params` or `params` methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a model consisting of an affine transformation followed by applying an elementwise logistic sigmoid transformation we first create a list of the two layer objects (in the order they are applied from inputs to outputs) and then use this to instantiate a new `MultipleLayerModel` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mlp.layers import AffineLayer, SigmoidLayer\n",
    "from mlp.models import MultipleLayerModel\n",
    "\n",
    "layers = [AffineLayer(input_dim, output_dim), SigmoidLayer()]\n",
    "model = MultipleLayerModel(layers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the modular way in which the layers are defined we can also stack an arbitrarily long sequence of layers together to produce deeper models. For instance the following would define a model consisting of three pairs of affine and logistic sigmoid transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = MultipleLayerModel([\n",
    "    AffineLayer(input_dim, hidden_dim), SigmoidLayer(),\n",
    "    AffineLayer(hidden_dim, hidden_dim), SigmoidLayer(),\n",
    "    AffineLayer(hidden_dim, output_dim), SigmoidLayer(),\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back-propagation of gradients\n",
    "  \n",
    "To allow training models consisting of a stack of multiple layers, all layers need to implement a `bprop` method in addition to the `fprop` we encountered in the previous week. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `bprop` method takes gradients of an error function with respect to the *outputs* of a layer and uses these gradients to calculate gradients of the error function with respect to the *inputs* of a layer. As the inputs to a non-input layer in a multiple-layer model consist of the outputs of the previous layer, this means we can calculate the gradients of the error function with respect to the outputs of every layer in the model by iteratively propagating the gradients backwards through the layers of the model (i.e. from the last to first layer), hence the term 'back-propagation' or 'bprop' for short. A block diagram illustrating this is shown for a three layer model below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='res/fprop-bprop-block-diagram.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "For a layer with parameters, the gradients with respect to the layer outputs are required to calculate gradients with respect to the layer parameters. Therefore by combining backward propagation of gradients through the model with computing the gradients with respect to parameters in the relevant layers we can calculate gradients of the error function with respect to all of the parameters of a multiple-layer model in a very efficient manner (in fact the computational cost of computing gradients with respect to all of the parameters of the model using this method will only be a constant factor times the cost of calculating the model outputs in the forwards pass).\n",
    "\n",
    "We so far have abstractly talked about calculating gradients with respect to the inputs of a layer using gradients with respect to the layer outputs. More concretely we will be using the chain rule for derivatives to do this, similarly to how we used the chain rule in exercise 4 of the previous notebook to calculate gradients with respect to the parameters of an affine layer given gradients with respect to the outputs of the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular if our layer has a batch of $B$ vector inputs each of dimension $D$, $\\left\\lbrace \\boldsymbol{x}^{(b)} \\right\\rbrace_{b=1}^B$, and produces a batch of $B$ vector outputs each of dimension $K$, $\\left\\lbrace \\boldsymbol{y}^{(b)}\\right\\rbrace_{b=1}^B$,  then we can calculate the gradient with respect to the $d^\\textrm{th}$ dimension of the $b^{\\textrm{th}}$ input given the gradients with respect to the $b^{\\textrm{th}}$ output using\n",

    "\n",
    "Mathematically therefore the `bprop` method takes an array of gradients with respect to the outputs $\\frac{\\partial y^{(b)}_k}{\\partial x^{(b)}_d}$ and applies a sum-product operation with the partial derivatives of each output with respect to each input $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{E}}{\\partial y^{(b)}_k}$ to produce gradients with respect to the inputs of the layer $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{E}}{\\partial x^{(b)}_d}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are now going to investigate using deeper multiple-layer model archictures for the MNIST classification task. You should experiment with training models with two to five `AffineLayer` transformations interleaved with `SigmoidLayer` nonlinear transformations. Intermediate hidden layers between the input and output should have a dimension of 100. For example the `layers` definition of a model with two `AffineLayer` transformations would be\n",

    "  * How does increasing the number of layers affect the model's performance on the training data set? And on the validation data set?\n",
    "  * Do deeper models seem to be harder or easier to train (e.g. in terms of ease of choosing training hyperparameters to give good final performance and/or quick convergence)?\n",
    "  * Do the models seem to be sensitive to the choice of the parameter initialisation range? Can you think of any reasons for why setting individual parameter initialisation scales for each `AffineLayer` in a model might be useful? Can you come up with (or find) any heuristics for setting the parameter initialisation scales?\n",

In particular that the gradients of the sigmoid become very close to zero (and may actually become exactly zero to a finite numerical precision) for very positive or negative inputs, and that the outputs are non-centred - they cover the interval $[0,\\,1]$ so negative outputs are never produced.\n",
