    "In this notebook we will explore autoencoder models. These are models in which the inputs are *encoded* to some intermediate representation before this representation is then *decoded* to try to reconstruct the inputs. They are example of a model which uses an unsupervised training method and are both interesting as a model in their own right and as a method for pre-training useful representations to use in supervised tasks such as classification. Autoencoders were covered as a pre-training method as additional material in the [sixth lecture slides](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/2018-19/mlp06-enc.pdf)."

To begin with we will consider models in which the encoder and decoder are both simple affine transformations.\n",

    "When training an autoencoder the target outputs for the model are the original inputs. A simple way to integrate this in to our `mlp` framework is to define a new data provider inheriting from a base data provider (e.g. `MNISTDataProvider`) which overrides the `next` method to return the inputs batch as both inputs and targets to the model. A data provider of this form has been provided for you in `mlp.data_providers` as `MNISTAutoencoderDataProvider`.\n",

You should use a sum of squared differences error and a basic gradient descent learning rule with learning rate 0.01. Initialise the biases to zero and use a uniform Glorot initialisation for both layers weights. Train the model for 25 epochs with a batch size of 50."

The intuition behind pretraining methods like this is that the hidden representations learnt by an autoencoder should be a more useful representation for training a classifier than the raw pixel values themselves. We could fix the parameters in the layers taken from the autoencoder but generally we can get better performance by letting the whole model be trained end-to-end on the supervised training task, with the learnt autoencoder parameters in this case acting as a potentially more intelligent initialisation than randomly sampling the parameters which can help ease some of the optimisation issues encountered due to poor initialisation of a model.\n",
