                the negative scaled gradient each update and so this rule
                collapses to standard gradient descent. If equal to 1 the
                momentum will just be decremented by the scaled gradient at
                each update. This is equivalent to simulating the dynamic in
                a frictionless system. Due to energy conservation the loss
                of 'potential energy' as the dynamics moves down the loss
                function surface will lead to an increasingly large 'kinetic
                energy' and so speed, meaning the updates will become
